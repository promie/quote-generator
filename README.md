# Random Quote Generator
Free Code Camp Intermediate Project. 
This project requires using an API to obtain data.Prior to completing this project, I've read up all about the API call functions - Vanilla JS (XMLHttpRequest()), jQuery $.getJSON and $.ajax().

For this project the $.getJSON was used. As there are a total of four API projects on Free Code Camp, I'll ensure to switch the usage of these API call functions.

Special thanks to my mentor Tony who provided guidance on the data structure.

### About the App
This app generates a random quote and author. There's a ten second interval so a fresh new quote is generated. 

NOTE: If you happen to become impatient and cannot wait ten seconds, feel free to bash the 'NEW QUOTE' button as many times as you want.

Check out the completed projected - [Random Quote Generator](https://promie.github.io/quote-generator/)
